Kademlia:
	-kademlia_4 contains most up-to-date version.

	DONE:
		-Store contact info on connection made.

	TODO:
		-HashTable (storing on file system)
			-> Bloom filter?
		-Refresh values that are older than tRefresh time, using a cron-like method.
		-Comparing current (generic) XMLRPC library with something like Rack-RPC.
			-> Can rack app be kept running across multiple requests?
		-Persist contact information.
		-Node ID generation using ECDSA. (+ storing this information in a file somewhere to persist?)
		-ensure find_node works as wanted (returning less than `k` nodes okay or not?)
		-Side-step value storage for occupied keys.
		-Debug scheduler. Maybe use Clockwork or similar?
		-Test running on multiple systems. (Local there seems to be a problem with XMLRPC + soft-threads that makes Client<->Server connection sometimes deadlock -> timeout)




Distributed Hash Tree (DH3):
	TODO:
		-Connect to Distributed Hash Table implemented above.

		-implement higher-level functionality + example application.

		-Write new version of paper
